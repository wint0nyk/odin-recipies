              <li> oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Position racks in the 
                upper and lower thirds of oven. Line 2 baking sheets with
                parchment paper.
              </li> 
              <li>
                Beat butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until fluffy, 
                about 4 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, beating until incorporated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Whisk together flour, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until
                combined. With mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture to 
                butter mixture, beating until well combined, about 2 minutes.
              </li> 
              <li>
                Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls, then roll balls in sanding sugar. 
                Place on the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Press 
                the center of each ball with your thumb (about 1/2-inch deep and 
                1/2-inch wide).
              </li> 
              <li>
                Bake in preheated oven in upper and lower thirds, 2 baking sheets at a 
                time, rotating top to bottom and bottom to top halfway through, until
                cookies are set and almost firm, 8 to 10 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Let cool on baking sheets, about 15 minutes. When cool, press the center of
                each ball with your thumb again—the indentations will have puffed in
                the oven.
              </li>
              <li>
                Heat cream in a small microwavable bowl on HIGH until just steaming, about 
                45 seconds. Remove from the heat, and add chopped chocolate. Let the 
                mixture sit, undisturbed, for 2 minutes. Stir until melted and smooth. 
                Let cool until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Place about 1 
                teaspoon filling in the center of each cookie. Slide the cookies into 
                the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to set the filling. The cookies 
                will keep for about 5 days in an airtight container at room temperature.

            <h1 class="heading1">PARMESAN AND BREAD CRUMBS</h1>
            <img src="pictures/chicken.jpg" width="300px height="auto">

        <p>This chicken breast recipe with mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and 
            herbs is a true tried-and-tested recipe! I remember seeing an ad on TV 
            about cooking with mayonnaise and decided to give it a shot. I've made it 
            with just the mayonnaise on top and it really locks the moisture into the 
            chicken. The bread crumbs and cheese are a must for me; they complement each 
            other very well.
        </p>

        <br>

    <h1 class="heading1">INGREDIENTS</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons bread crumbs, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons herbes de Provence</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

    <h1 class="heading1">DIRECTIONS</h1>
        <ol>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place chicken 
            breasts in a baking pan. 
        </ol>
        <ol>Mix Parmesan cheese and mayonnaise together in a bowl until well combined; 
            spread evenly over chicken breasts. Coat with bread crumbs and sprinkle 
            with herbes de Provence. 
        </ol>
        <ol>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in 
            the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read 
            thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F 
            (74 degrees C).
