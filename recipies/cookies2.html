        <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>
            <ol>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Position racks in the 
                <br>upper and lower thirds of oven. Line 2 baking sheets with
                <br>parchment paper. 
            </ol>
            <ol>Beat butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until fluffy, 
                <br>about 4 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, beating until incorporated.
            </ol>
            <ol>Whisk together flour, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until
                <br>combined. With mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture to 
                <br>butter mixture, beating until well combined, about 2 minutes. 
            </ol>
            <ol>Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls, then roll balls in sanding sugar. 
                <br>Place on the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Press 
                <br>the center of each ball with your thumb (about 1/2-inch deep and 
                <br>1/2-inch wide). 
            </ol>
            <ol> Bake in preheated oven in upper and lower thirds, 2 baking sheets at a 
                <br>time, rotating top to bottom and bottom to top halfway through, until
                <br>cookies are set and almost firm, 8 to 10 minutes.
            </ol>
            <ol>Let cool on baking sheets, about 15 minutes. When cool, press the center of
                <br>each ball with your thumb again—the indentations will have puffed in
                <br>the oven.
            </ol>
            <ol>Heat cream in a small microwavable bowl on HIGH until just steaming, about 
                <br>45 seconds. Remove from the heat, and add chopped chocolate. Let the 
                <br>mixture sit, undisturbed, for 2 minutes. Stir until melted and smooth. 
                <br>Let cool until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Place about 1 
                <br>teaspoon filling in the center of each cookie. Slide the cookies into 
                <br>the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to set the filling. The cookies 
                <br>will keep for about 5 days in an airtight container at room temperature. 
            </ol>
