# odin-recipies

This is my first project from TOP. During this process I expect to put basic HTML, CSS, and command line skills to work which I've learned in the previous chapters. In this project I will be creating a basic recipie website. I will update this README at the end of the project for a self-reflection on what I learn in the process and where I feel like I need to improve.
